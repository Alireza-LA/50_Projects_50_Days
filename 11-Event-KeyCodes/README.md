A simple and interactive web app that displays the **key, keyCode, and code** values whenever you press a key on your keyboard.  
Perfect for learning about keyboard events in JavaScript or debugging input handling in web projects.

## 🧩 How It Works
1. When the user presses any key on the keyboard, the app listens for the `keydown` event.  
2. The **key**, **keyCode**, and **code** are extracted from the event object.  
3. These values are displayed dynamically on the page, replacing the placeholder text.  
4. If the spacebar is pressed, it’s displayed as `"Space"` for clarity.

## 📜 Example Output
Pressing the **"A"** key shows:
```
event.key: A
event.keyCode: 65
event.code: KeyA
```
