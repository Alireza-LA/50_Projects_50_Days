# 🎯 Random Choice Picker

An interactive and fun project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, allowing users to enter multiple options (separated by commas) and have one **randomly selected** in a visually engaging way.  
Perfect for making quick decisions — like picking a movie, food, or team member!
