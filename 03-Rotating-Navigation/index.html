            <h1>This Is What It's Like to Come to the United States as a Refugee</h1>
            <small>One story of coming to America from the Soviet Union</small>
            <p>This is what it’s like to be a refugee.<br>Thousands of miles away, people haggle over policy details,
                about whether you are a risk and a burden, or an asset full of potential, a victim, or a potential tool
                of foreign policy, but really they are talking about you, and the days of your life and how you will
                live them.

                They don’t know you. They don’t know the days of your life that you have already lived, and the stuff of
                your mind and the strength in your hands. To them, you are an abstraction, colored by their fear and
                their hate, or by their heartrending idealism.

                They do not see your parents, waiting in line for hours at the American embassy in Moscow, stamping
                their feet in the cold, holding their documents, practicing for their interview. They do not know that
                your mother never wanted to leave this city, because she was born here and bore children here, and has
                friends and family here, and has removed the tonsils of hundreds of children. She has performed delicate
                surgeries that have made the deaf hear again, and she knows she could have restored Beethoven’s hearing
                in half an hour, a thought that brings her the kind of satisfaction that can only come to someone who
                knows what symphonies and concertos her children heard when they swam in her belly as she sat swimming
                in the sound spilling from the walls of the grand old hall of the Moscow Conservatory.</p>

                alt="Refugee people">
            <p>They don’t
                know that she was happy here, even though she had never wanted to be a doctor. Even though her red
                diploma, the mark of a perfectionist student, even her flawless French couldn’t get her into the
                university that trained translators, because her papers and her face said she was Jewish, even though
                her grandparents had Russified their Jewish last name, and her parents gave her the name of an old
                Russian princess who was the first Russian saint. These people knew that Jews were being persecuted in
                the Soviet Union, kept out of schools and jobs for a religion most of them had abandoned generations ago
                but that had become a blood type that resigned you to second-class status.</p>
