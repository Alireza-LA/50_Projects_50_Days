# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) ❓

A clean and interactive FAQ section built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Users can expand or collapse each question to reveal its answer, making it a great component for any website that needs a responsive, user-friendly help section.

## 🧩 How It Works
1. Each FAQ item consists of a **question**, **answer**, and a **toggle button**.  
2. When the toggle button is clicked, a JavaScript function adds or removes the `active` class from the parent element.  
3. The **CSS** uses the `.active` class to reveal or hide the answer text with smooth transitions.  
4. The icons (`chevron-down` / `times`) automatically switch using conditional visibility in CSS.

## 💡 Example Interaction
- Default view: only the questions are visible.  
- When a user clicks the toggle:  
  - The question’s background changes to white  
  - The answer appears below it  
  - The icon switches from a **down arrow** to an **X (close)** symbol
