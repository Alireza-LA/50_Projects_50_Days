## 📝 Step 2: Update the **main repository README.md**

Now edit your main repo’s `README.md` (at root) so it includes this new project.  
Use this version — it includes all three projects and is ready to replace your current main README:

```markdown
# 🧪 50 Projects in 50 Days

A collection of **mini frontend projects** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — inspired by the *"50 Projects in 50 Days"* challenge.  
Each project is stored in its own folder and focuses on mastering a specific UI pattern or interactive concept.

## 🧩 About This Repository

This repository serves as my **hands-on frontend learning journey**, where I build 50 small, focused projects to:
- Strengthen my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals  
- Learn UI design patterns and microinteractions  
- Improve code structure and reusability  
- Build consistency and discipline in daily development  

Each project is small, visual, and interactive — perfect for learning by doing.
